- Question 1: What are the denominations of the US coins from the green, blue and orange
distributions? Can you think why the coins from the same denomination might show variation in
weight although they are specified to be of the same weight? If your vending machine had a
weight sensor, how would you use the weight of a coin that was just inserted to find the
denomination?

The green represents a penny, the blue represents a nickel, and the orange represents a dollar. The
reason why the coins might show slight variation is because there is a lot of different facotrs that can 
impact a coin's weight such as oxidation or even rust. Furthermore, if I was using a vending machine that
has a weight sensor, I would compare the weight of the coin to the range of weights for each coin denomination. 
Each coin denomination will have a ranage that will aproximate the weight of the coin. Using this range, the 
weight sensor will identify the coin if the weight falls within the range.  

- Question 2: We can shine light on the coin and measure the reflected amount of light which
should be proportional (directly or in some non-linear way) to the size/area of the coin. Can you
guess which sensor on the Grove Pi Kit can be used for this purpose?

The grove light sesnor can be used to measure the reflected amount of light. 

- Question 3: Which of the following datasets are linearly separable? Justify your answer.

Clearly datasets A, C, and D are linearly separable. This is because when you see the two data sets, 
there is clear fit with for a linear line

- Question 4: Sometimes we need more than a simple hyperplane to separate the datasets of the
two classes. What are some other simple geometric entities other than a simple plane/line that
can be used to separate some of the data points that were not linearly separable?

There are other shapes that can be used to seperate datapoints that are NOT linear. For example, if we look at 
the graph in F, the data clearly shows an ellipse. Furthrmore, other shapes can also be used such as a circle, 
parabolas, and hyperbolas. 
Circle: (x−a)^2+(y−b)^2=r^2
Parabola: (y−b)^2=4p(x−a)
Ellipse: (x−a)^2/h^2+(y−b)^2/k^2=1
Hyperbola: (x−a)^2/h^2−(y−b)^2/k^2=1

- Question 5: For example shown in the figure, what is approximately the output of the neuron?

For the picture above, the neuron will be a sigmoid function where the X^(T)W is the weights and w_0 
is a vector which represents the bias of a neuron. The sigmoid function will also include a y intercept 
at (0,0.5).
